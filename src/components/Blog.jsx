His career is best summed up by one of his own quotes: \"If you don't believe you are the best, then you will never achieve all that you are capable of.\" Ronaldo has shown that belief throughout more than two decades at the top of world soccer and often proved it to be true.\n\n\"He is the best,\" his former Real Madrid manager, Jose Mourinho, said. \"I saw Maradona a couple of times. I never saw Pel√©. But Cristiano is amazing. This man is the best. Cristiano is a goal machine. There will never be another Ronaldo.\" -- Rob Dawson",
